*Zangetsu Framework*

Zangetsu is the framework I intend to make power many of my applications going forward. My current goal is to isolate more and more code that is general and not application specific and move it into this framework. This framework is made available under the Open Source MIT License.

Zangetsu differs from other frameworks in some ways
It only supports Mac OS X 10.6 and later
It only supports Garbage Collection (libauto)
It will be built to take advantage of features in LLVM/Clang Compiler

The Framework will try and always take advantage of the latest features on Mac OS X, to use features on older versions of Mac OS X you can refeer back to older versions of the framework.

**What does Zangetsu mean?**

Zangetsu ( 斬月 ) is Japanese and means Slaying Moon. The inspiration for the name for this project comes from the Japanese Anime Bleach. Specifically a character called Ichigo Kurosaki and his zanpakutō (斬魄刀?, literally "soul-cutter sword"). It is a sword that takes many shapes. In the same way I intend this framework to do the same.

**Where is the Documentation**
There is no documentation...yet. There will be documenation in the future.
