# Zangetsu Framework #

Zangetsu is a general purpose 64 bit capable Garbage Collected Framework for Mac OS X 10.6 and later. It has a number of convenience functions and Foundation categories that help in the development of Mac OS X Cocoa applications. It is the framework that helps power many of my apps. Going forward as I can more and more non application specific code from my apps will be added to this Framework. This framework is made available under the Open Source MIT License.

## What's in Zangetsu? ##

Zangetsu contains

* Macros to make creating NSDictionaries, NSArrays, etc easy

* Easy debug logging

* SHA1 Convenience Methods

* NSTask Conveience Methods

* Host Version Info Convenience Methods

* Additional methods for NSArray, NSDictionary, NSSet & NSString to make using & enumerating over them easier.

## What does Zangetsu mean? ##

Zangetsu ( 斬月 ) is Japanese and means Slaying Moon. The inspiration for the name for this project comes from the Japanese Anime Bleach. Specifically a character called Ichigo Kurosaki and his zanpakutō ((斬魄刀) literally "soul-cutter sword"). It is a sword that takes many shapes. In the same way I intend this framework to do the same.
