**Zangetsu Framework**

Zangetsu is the framework I intend to make power many of my applications going forward. My current goal is to isolate more and more code that is general and not application specific and move it into this framework. This framework is made available under the Open Source MIT License.

**What does Zangetsu mean?**

Zangetsu ( 斬月 ) is Japanese and means Slaying Moon. The inspiration for the name for this project comes from the Japanese Anime Bleach. Specifically a character called Ichigo Kurosaki and his zanpakutō (斬魄刀?, literally "soul-cutter sword"). It is a sword that takes many shapes. In the same way I intend this framework to do the same.
